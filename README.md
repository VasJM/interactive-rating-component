## My process

### Built with

- Love ðŸ’–
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Taking breaks is **VERY** important. But other than that, CSS Grid is super handy! This project was easy, with only a few hiccups because I'm Jared 19 and I never learned how to read ðŸ¤™

### Continued development

SVGs. Work more with SVGs. Definitely.

### Useful resources

[MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) my most beloved, I would be so lost without her ðŸ’–
